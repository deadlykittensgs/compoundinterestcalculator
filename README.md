this is my Compound interest calculator that pomps a user for an input, and calculates the compound interest value 


#1 define a function that can find the final value of the compound interest 

#2 define a function that can calculate the difference (ie the impact that compounding has had )

#3 create a run function that pomps user for inputs to calculate the final amount.

#4 clean up functions and print statement using a template literal string that gives the financial breakdown
